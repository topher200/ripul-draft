Here is the final draft list with baggage compensation.  Please cross people out on your database list that are NOT on this list.  That will save ALOT of time.
 
There is 1 guy and 2 women (Jessica Nunn, Nanci Praire, and Jeff Lavery) that paid but did not sign up online so if anybody knows them, please speak up.
 
baggage compensation - for guys it is based on when the snake starts (pick 20).  For women it is simply overall.  If you have a 1st round female as a captain or as an assignment, you can still pick a 1st round baggage woman and she would be your #2.
 
please review baggage compensation and if you think the compensation is way off, please let me know.
 
palin/simmons, broestl/gill and bloom/topher all lose picks in round 5
 
the draft will be tomorrow at 6.  I will pay for dinner and would like to get the draft started ASAP.  Please be considerate and pick quickly.  I don't want to lose my temper with the slow pokes again.
 
I would email your team before Monday.  You can get the email list by going to the draft database, hitting all fields/columns, and that will have everybody's email address.
 
Games are straight to 17, no win by 2.
1 timeout/half + floater
11th edition rules in effect
no zone for the 1st 2 weeks (4 games)
 
default is 5/2 but if both captains agree play 4/3-5/2 O decides.  the more 4/3, the better.  all teams will have 6 women.
 
any general issues, use this email list.
any specific issues, email/talk to me.
