Currently, it looks like the ladies will be about even after round one so we'll
start the snake at the top of round 2. However, there are still a bunch of lady
spots left so if there's a big influx of talent we may change things.

Please keep in mind with the lady draft that a LOT of the ladies have attendance
issues. Keep track of that as you draft, you don't want four ladies who are all
20-40 and tournament maybes.

Baggage:

There are some weaker ladies who are paired with much stronger men. We are doing
something we've never done before to prevent these weaker ladies from being
drafted too high: there will be mandatory auto-trades of ladies once their
respective men are drafted.

For example: Team A has drafted Victoria in round 3. She is a beginner lady who
is paired with seasoned veteran popper Matthew. Team B drafted Sherri in round
3. Team B later drafts Matthew. Team A must auto-trade Victoria to team B
(Matthew's team) and receive Sherri in exchange. If Sherri would be an unfair
trade we will auto-trade someone of similar value.

So this means if you want to keep Victoria, be sure to draft Matthew. Or at
least know that if you don't draft Matthew, you will be getting someone else who
you didn't pick. Also, if you draft Matthew, know that you will be giving away
one of your later lady picks.

If this is confusing, talk to us at the draft.

Approved Baggage Requests:
Bill Brown- Nathan Brown- Colin Brown- 9th and 11th (or 10th 11th if Bill is 9th round)
Mel Hershey- Scott Butson- 6th
Nikki Silva- Daniel Roach- 5th
Samantha Chapman Ben Weinstein (auto-trade)
Celinda Kofron	        Mike Kofron (6th round)
Christen Scanlon       Steve Panasuik (auto-trade, but will likely be assigned to Tim/Jenna to save time)
Dorothy Kimel-Scott	Karen Kimel-Scott (2nd round)
Jillian Fournier	        Elizabeth Fournier (Last round)
Erin O'Dell                 James Acone 10th round
Ingrid Werge	        Geoff whitehead (5th)
Kristen Williams	        Isaac Peters Cooper (auto-trade)
Jenna Palin	        Justin Palin (2nd round)
Kristy Woo	        Sean Broestl (9th round)
Kristin Mahan            Devon Kosowan (Kristin as last round female)
Topher Brown	        Russell Brown and Chris Raymond (5th and 11th)
Sarah Sams              Zachary DiSalvo (auto-trade)

The men's draft is essentially a snake except we are giving Steve/Annie an extra
pick at the top of round 2. We were always going to take away a later pick to
account for this but didn't decide on a round until the men's draft was
full. After some discussion, we are taking away their round 2 pick (32). Plan
accordingly.
